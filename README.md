# weather app react js

A responsive weather app prototype. Using:

* React.js
* Chart.js
* React-Bootstrap
* Apollo Client
* GraphQL Wrapper for Open Weather Map API <https://github.com/konstantinmuenster/graphql-weather-api>


Current Prototype Features:

* Show Current weather
	* Description (ie. sunny)
	* Current temperature
	* Today's high temperature
	* Today's low temperature
	* Wind Speed
	* Humidity
	* Pressure
	* Sunrise/Sunset Time


Due to limitations of the API the data for humidity, pressure, sun times and forecast are mocked. In the future i want to expand the API to the full functionality of Open Weather Map API to use it with this project. From the UI aspect i want to use the design of the google weather widget.
